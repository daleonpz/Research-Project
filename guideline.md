You can use the \LaTeX Diploma Template Document Content from the next page.

The diploma should be on standard A4 size sheets. Pages should be made with a mirror finish (2.5 cm everywhere, 1 cm on the left side). The default font is the 12-point Times New Roman, with a duplicate line spacing.

All pages - except for the first four structural elements - must have the page number.

The chapters should be given a decimal position. The figures are to be inserted in the appropriate place, each with a decimal number and an expressive title. The chapters are numbered by a decimal subtraction with a maximum of 3 subtractions in depth (eg 2.3.4.1). Figures, tables and formulas should be numbered separately in chapters (eg Figure 2.4, Table 4.2 or Formula (3.2)). Align the chapter titles to the left, and use regular alignment for the standard text. Align the diagrams, tables and the corresponding title in the middle. The address is below the marked part.

Create images as much as possible with a drawing program, and use the equation editor to describe the equations (A \LaTeX provides solutions that are straightforward).

Interpretation of the literary reference may be made in the Harvard system (by author and by year) or by serial number. The full list is listed at the end of the list in the order of the list (in case of numbered literary references in order of reference). However, the titles of the literary sources must always be given in the original language, possibly in parentheses with the translation. All publications in the list must be referred to in the text (the \LaTeX template uses Bib\TeX to automatically handle this). Each publication has the following information for the authors: journal articles, the exact title, journal title, year, number, page number from to. Only abbreviate the journal titles if they are very familiar or very long. When entering Internet links, it is important to specify the owner and content of the page before the path (since the link may become unavailable after a while) and the time of access.

Important:

* The statement of the thesis writer / diplomat (with the text contained in this template) is mandatory. In our absence, the thesis / diploma can not be judged and can not be defended.
* Both the essay and the attachment can be up to 15 MB in size!

Good work, successful thesis preparation, we wish you a diploma!
