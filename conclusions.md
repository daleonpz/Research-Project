Conclusions {.unnumbered}
============

The design and development of a rover-app has been presented.
The application allows a Rover to follow without human intervention a visual marker on another Rover. 
The described rover-app  is based on `OpenCV` libraries and rover-services to interface with camera, motors and sensors mounted on Rover.  
Our experimental results show the high accuracy of our application to estimate the  distance to the marker, and the existence of an almost constant error in the angle estimation.
Moreover, we presented some challenges and issues such as maximum detectable rotations of the visual marker, limited camera visual field, errors measuring distance traveled and migration to AGL.
