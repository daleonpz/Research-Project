Conclusions
============

The design and development of a rover-app has been presented.
The application allows a Rover to follow without human intervention a visual marker on another Rover. 
The described rover-app  is based on `OpenCV` libraries and rover-services to interface with camera, motors and sensors mounted on Rover.  
Our experimental results show the accuracy of our application.
Moreover, we presented some challenges and issues related to our application, and how to address them in future versions.
