Abstract {.unnumbered}
========

The purpose of this research project is to develop an application for Rover in-vehicle platform in the context of APPSTACLE project and Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem. 
The application allows a Rover to follow without human intervention a visual marker on another Rover. 
`OpenCV` libraries and Eclipse Kuksa services are the main building blocks of the application.  


Our experimental results show the accuracy of the application to estimate and reach the target position. 
Moreover, we described challenges and issues related to our application and how to address them.
