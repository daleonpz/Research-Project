Abstract {.unnumbered}
========

The purpose of this research project is to develop an application for the Rover in-vehicle platform in the context of the APPSTACLE project and the Eclipse Kuksa ecosystem. 
The application allows a Rover to follow a visual marker without human intervention, this opens the door to more advanced computer vision application.


`OpenCV` libraries and Eclipse Kuksa services are the main building blocks of the application.
Experimental results show the accuracy of the application to estimate and reach the target position. The error in the experiments is in the range of 0.4 cm and 0.7 cm.  
Moreover, challenge ,issues and possible solutions of the application are outlined.
